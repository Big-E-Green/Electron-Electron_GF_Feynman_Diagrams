# Greens Function Feynman Diagrams

With the application of Wick's theorem on a Green's function series, Feynman diagrams can be obtained. This code generates all possible permutations of a given Green's function and via Feynman rules reduces them to their connected topologically inequivalent form. With functionality extending to any order of correction (i.e. N = any real intiger).

This also includes the generation of these diagrams visually, for any given correction.
